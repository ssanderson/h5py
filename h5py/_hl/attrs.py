        Allows dictionary-style access to an HDF5 object's attributes.

        These are created exclusively by the library and are available as
        a Python attribute at <object>.attrs

        Like Group objects, attributes provide a minimal dictionary-
        style interface.  Anything which can be reasonably converted to a
        Numpy array or Numpy scalar can be stored.

        Attributes are automatically created on assignment with the
        syntax <obj>.attrs[name] = value, with the HDF5 type automatically
        deduced from the value.  Existing attributes are overwritten.

        To modify an existing attribute while preserving its type, use the
        method modify().  To specify an attribute of a particular type and
        shape, use create().
